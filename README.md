Ever wanted to catch PokÃ©monâ€¦ but instead of throwing PokÃ©balls, you use API requests?
Well, this little NodeJS app  lets you do exactly that. ðŸŽ‰

What This Project Does ðŸš€

GET /pokemons â†’ Picks a random PokÃ©mon from the PokÃ©API
 and tries to save it as your favorite, if the Pokemon is of the strong ones.

POST /favorites â†’ Save your own favorite PokÃ©mon manually (if they have base experience â‰¥ 100).

GET /favorites â†’ See all the PokÃ©mon youâ€™ve honored with a spot in your heart (and your database).

DELETE /favorites/name/:name â†’ Release a PokÃ©mon from your favorites (sad but sometimes necessary ðŸª¦).
